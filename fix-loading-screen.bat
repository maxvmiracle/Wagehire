echo Simplifying LoadingScreen to show only loading elements on animated background...
echo.
echo âœ¨ Simplified approach:
echo 1. Removed all containers that cover the background
echo 2. Kept only the loading elements (icon, text, progress)
echo 3. Added drop shadows for better visibility
echo 4. Background animation remains fully visible
echo 5. Clean and minimal loading experience
echo.
echo ðŸŽ¨ Loading elements:
echo - Bouncing icon with glow effect
echo - Gradient text with drop shadows
echo - Animated dots with drop shadows
echo - Progress bar with backdrop blur
echo - Floating particles in background
echo.
git add .
git commit -m "Simplify LoadingScreen: show only loading elements on animated background"
git push origin main
echo.
echo ðŸš€ Changes pushed! Vercel should automatically redeploy.
echo.
echo âœ¨ After deployment, you'll see:
echo - Full animated background visible
echo - Only loading elements floating on top
echo - Clean and minimal loading experience
echo - No containers covering the background
echo - Beautiful and seamless integration
