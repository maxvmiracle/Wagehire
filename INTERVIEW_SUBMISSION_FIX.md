# Interview Submission Fix

## Issue Description
The interview submission was failing with a 500 server error due to a database schema mismatch. The `interviews` table was missing two required columns:
- `interview_type` 
- `interviewer_linkedin_url`

## Root Cause
There were two different database schema files:
1. `backend/database/init.js` - Had the complete schema with all required columns
2. `backend/database/db.js` - Had an outdated schema missing the required columns

The routes were using `db.js` which had the incomplete schema, causing the INSERT query to fail.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Database Schema (`backend/database/db.js`)
- Added missing `interview_type TEXT DEFAULT 'technical'` column
- Added missing `interviewer_linkedin_url TEXT` column
- Updated users table to include password reset columns

### 2. Created Migration Script (`backend/migrate-database.js`)
- Automatically detects missing columns
- Adds missing columns to existing databases
- Works for both development and production environments

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling (`backend/routes/interviews.js`)
- Added detailed error logging
- Added fallback mechanism for missing columns
- Better error messages for debugging

### 4. Server Integration (`backend/server.js`)
- Added automatic migration on server startup
- Ensures database schema is always up-to-date

### 5. Testing Tools
- `test-database.js` - Verifies database schema
- `test-database.bat` - Easy testing script

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Automatic Fix (Recommended)
Run the comprehensive fix script:
```bash
fix-interview-submission.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual Steps
1. Run database migration:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node migrate-database.js
   ```

2. Test the database:
   ```bash
   node test-database.js
   ```

3. Restart the server

## Verification
After applying the fix:
1. The interview submission form should work without errors
2. All interview data should be saved correctly
3. The `interview_type` and `interviewer_linkedin_url` fields should be properly stored

## Files Modified
- `backend/database/db.js` - Updated schema
- `backend/routes/interviews.js` - Enhanced error handling
- `backend/server.js` - Added migration integration
- `backend/migrate-database.js` - New migration script
- `backend/test-database.js` - New testing script

## Files Created
- `fix-interview-submission.bat` - Comprehensive fix script
- `test-database.bat` - Database testing script
- `INTERVIEW_SUBMISSION_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Prevention
The server now automatically runs migrations on startup, preventing similar schema issues in the future.
