# Quick Fix for Current Deployment Issue

## Problem
You're seeing `{"error":"Route not found"}` when accessing your deployed application.

## Root Cause
The current deployment is trying to serve the frontend from a separate service, but you're accessing the backend URL directly.

## Solution

### Option 1: Use the Correct URL (Immediate Fix)
If you have separate frontend and backend services:
- **Frontend URL:** `https://wagehire-frontend.onrender.com` (or your frontend service name)
- **Backend API:** `https://wagehire-backend.onrender.com/api/*`

### Option 2: Redeploy with Single Service (Recommended)

1. **Delete your current services** in Render dashboard
2. **Push the updated code** to your repository
3. **Create a new single service** using the updated `render.yaml`

#### Steps:
1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Click "New +" → "Blueprint"
3. Connect your repository
4. Render will automatically use the `render.yaml` configuration

#### What the updated configuration does:
- ✅ Builds both frontend and backend in one service
- ✅ Serves React app from root URL (`https://wagehire.onrender.com`)
- ✅ Serves API from `/api/*` (`https://wagehire.onrender.com/api/health`)
- ✅ Handles React routing properly

### Option 3: Manual Single Service Setup

If you prefer manual setup:

1. **Create a new Web Service**
2. **Configure as follows:**
   - **Name:** `wagehire`
   - **Build Command:** `npm run install-all && npm run build`
   - **Start Command:** `cd backend && node server.js`
   - **Environment Variables:**
     ```
     NODE_ENV=production
     PORT=10000
     REACT_APP_API_URL=/api
     ```
   - **Health Check Path:** `/api/health`

## Expected Result

After fixing, you should be able to access:
- **Main App:** `https://your-service-name.onrender.com`
- **Health Check:** `https://your-service-name.onrender.com/api/health`
- **API Endpoints:** `https://your-service-name.onrender.com/api/*`

## Test Commands

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-service-name.onrender.com/api/health

# Expected response:
{"status":"OK","message":"Wagehire API is running"}
```

## If You Still See Issues

1. **Check Render logs** for build errors
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Ensure the service is running** (not sleeping)
4. **Wait a few minutes** after deployment for full startup
