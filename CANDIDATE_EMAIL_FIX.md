# üö® Candidate Email Verification Fix

## üîç Problem Identified
Candidates are trying to register but not receiving email verification links because:
- EMAIL_USER is set: `maaxvman92@gmail.com`
- EMAIL_PASS is missing (Gmail App Password not configured)
- Email service cannot authenticate with Gmail

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Fix Solution

### Option 1: Automated Fix (Recommended)
```bash
cd backend
npm run fix-email
```

This will:
1. Guide you through Gmail App Password setup
2. Create/update the .env file
3. Test the email configuration
4. Provide next steps

### Option 2: Manual Fix

#### Step 1: Set up Gmail App Password
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Enable "2-Step Verification" if not already enabled
3. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
4. Select "Mail" and "Other"
5. Click "Generate" and copy the 16-character password

#### Step 2: Create .env file
Create a file named `.env` in the `backend` directory with this content:

```env
# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here

# Email Configuration (for Gmail)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=maaxvman92@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=YOUR_16_CHARACTER_APP_PASSWORD_HERE

# Frontend URL (for email links)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Database Reset (set to 'true' to reset database on startup)
RESET_DB=false

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV=development
```

**Replace `YOUR_16_CHARACTER_APP_PASSWORD_HERE` with your actual app password**

#### Step 3: Test Configuration
```bash
cd backend
npm run test-email
```

#### Step 4: Restart Server
```bash
npm start
```

## üîÑ Manual Verification (Immediate Solution)

If email still doesn't work, use manual verification for existing candidates:

### Method 1: Command Line Tool
```bash
cd backend
npm run manual-verify
```

This will:
- Show all unverified candidates
- Provide manual verification URLs
- Allow you to verify candidates directly

### Method 2: Frontend Manual Verification
1. After registration, candidates see manual verification option
2. Click "Get Manual Verification Link"
3. Click the generated link to verify

### Method 3: Direct API Call
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/auth/manual-verification/candidate-email@example.com
```

## üß™ Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Check Environment
```bash
cd backend
node -e "require('dotenv').config(); console.log('EMAIL_USER:', process.env.EMAIL_USER); console.log('EMAIL_PASS:', process.env.EMAIL_PASS ? 'Set' : 'Not set');"
```

### Test 2: Test Email Service
```bash
cd backend
npm run test-email
```

### Test 3: Test Registration
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/register
2. Register a new candidate
3. Check if verification email is received
4. If email fails, use manual verification

## üìã Verification Checklist

- [ ] EMAIL_PASS set with app password
- [ ] Server restarted after configuration

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Authentication failed"

### Issue 2: "Connection failed"
**Solution**: Check internet and verify EMAIL_HOST/EMAIL_PORT

### Issue 3: Emails not received
**Solutions**:
- Check spam/junk folder
- Use manual verification as fallback
- Add sender to contacts

### Issue 4: Manual verification not working
**Solutions**:
- Check token expiration (24 hours)

## üéØ Expected Results

After fixing:
1. **Registration**: Candidates register successfully
2. **Email Verification**: Verification emails sent automatically
3. **Manual Fallback**: Manual verification works if email fails
4. **Login**: Verified candidates can login
5. **Security**: Unverified candidates cannot login
